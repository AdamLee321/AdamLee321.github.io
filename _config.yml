  Greetings, travelers of Middle-earth! I am Adam, a seasoned wizard of the digital realm, here to regale you with tales of my adventures as a senior mobile & web developer! 🧙‍♂️💻

  For a decade now, I've been casting spells in the mystical lands of mobile apps, akin to mastering the arcane arts of the elven smiths. And lo, for a full decade and more, I've treaded the paths of the web, much like the resilient dwarves delving deep into the heart of the mountains! ⚔️💼

  In my time as a digital voyager, I've embarked on over 60 epic quests, each one a saga worthy of the bards' songs! Many of these quests have found their way into the halls of Valinor, gracing the Apple and Android app stores with their presence! 📱🌌

  But fear not, for I am not merely a solitary wanderer. Nay, I have braved the perils of teamwork, standing shoulder to shoulder with brave comrades, just like the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor. And when the path has led me to solitary shores, I've faced the challenges alone, much like Frodo on his solemn quest to destroy the One Ring. 🌋💍

  So, whether I'm marching alongside allies or venturing forth on my own, you can trust in my prowess to craft digital wonders that rival the majesty of Middle-earth itself! 🌟✨

  My most esteemed qualities: <mark>React Native</mark>, <mark>ReactJS</mark>, <mark>Swift</mark>, <mark>Kotlin</mark>, <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>C#</mark> and <mark>SQL</mark>

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
